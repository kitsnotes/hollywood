.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates an image of an operating environment.  The environment is
configured per a provided HorizonScript file.
.Ss Image Creation
The
.Nm
utility first executes the HorizonScript in a temporary directory, called
the
.Em intermediate directory .
From there, the
.Nm
utility then creates the image using the files present in the intermediate
directory.  The intermediate directory is not removed after image creation,
allowing inspection of the files used to create the image.
.Ss Image Formats
The
.Nm
utility can be extended with new image formats by writing a new backend.
The backends included with the default distribution include:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It tar
Creates a pax-extended ustar archive.  See
.Xr 1p pax
for a description of the on-disk format.  This archive may be extracted to
the desired system at a later time.
.It tgz, tbz, txz
Creates a pax-extended ustar archive, like tar, but additionally compresses
the archive with
.Xr 1 gzip
(tgz),
.Xr 1 bzip2
(tbz), or
.Xr 1 xz
(txz).
