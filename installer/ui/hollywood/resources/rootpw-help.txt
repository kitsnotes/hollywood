<h2>Set Root Passphrase</h2>

<p>This page allows you to set the passphrase for the root user.  The
<em>root user</em> is known in some other systems as the "Administrator" user.
This passphrase is used when performing certain administrative tasks on the
system, and for system recovery.</p>

<p>It is important that you set a unique passphrase for the root user, as
anyone with the root user's passphrase can access any data on your computer.
You should write it down and keep it in a safe place.</p>
