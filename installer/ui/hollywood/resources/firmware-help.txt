<h2>Firmware</h2>

<p>This page allows you to decide whether or not to install proprietary
firmware on this computer.</p>

<h3>What is firmware?</h3>

<p>"Firmware" is a component of a hardware driver.  This component is uploaded
to the hardware itself, which allows the hardware to perform operations or
control itself.</p>

<p>For example, network devices sometimes contain firmware that allows them to
perform checksum offloading.</p>

<h3>What is <i>proprietary</i> firmware?</h3>

<p>Proprietary firmware is firmware that is released by the hardware
manufacturer without source code.  Usually, this proprietary firmware is
provided without warranty by the hardware manufacturer.  Since it is closed
source and fully proprietary, it cannot be audited for security or reliability
issues.</p>

<p>This means that when you load proprietary firmware on to a computer, we
can no longer provide any assurances to its security or reliability.</p>

<h3>Why would I want to load proprietary firmware?</h3>

<p>Most wireless networking cards, and virtually all 3D graphics cards, utilise
proprietary firmware.  You may be unable to connect to a wireless network, or
use certain radio frequencies (such as the 5 GHz band), without proprietary
firmware.  You may also be unable to use the maximum resolution of your
graphics card, or utilise the 3D acceleration capabilities of it (including
OpenGL and Vulkan), without proprietary firmware.</p>

<h3>What are the risks of using proprietary firmware?</h3>

<p>Your system may be compromised by security issues in the firmware.  Your
system may also become unstable due to improper programming of the
firmware.</p>

<h3>Which option should I choose?</h3>

<p>Ad√©lie Linux allows you the freedom to choose whether or not you wish to
install proprietary firmware on your computer.</p>

<p>If you have an elevated threat profile, you should always choose No.</p>

<p>If you want to utilise hardware that requires proprietary firmware despite
the potential risk, you may choose Yes.</p>
