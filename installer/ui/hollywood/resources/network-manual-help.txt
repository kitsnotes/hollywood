<h2>Configure Your Network</h2>

<p>This page allows you to input the proper configuration for your network
connection.</p>

<h3>Choosing a protocol</h3>

<p>System Installation requires you to specify manual configuration for each
network protocol in use on your system.  If you use automatic configuration
for one protocol, and manual configuration for another, you must enable the
automatically configured protocol later.</p>

<h3>What should I input for a DNS server?</h3>

<p>If your network administrator did not provide you a preferred DNS server
to use, we recommend you use the default value of 9.9.9.9.  This server is
provided as a public service to the Internet by Quad9, focused on ensuring
user privacy.</p>
