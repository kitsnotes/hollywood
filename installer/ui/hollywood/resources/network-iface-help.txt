<h2>Network Interface Selection</h2>

<p>This page is shown when your computer has multiple network interfaces.
Select the one that you wish to use during installation.  You can configure
additional network interfaces after installation.</p>

<h3>How do I know which interface to select?</h3>

<ul>
 <li>If you use a wireless connection, select <b>Wi-Fi</b>.</li>
 <li>If you use a wired connection, select <b>Ethernet</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not sure which interface is correct, and you know the MAC address
of your interface, use the mouse to hover over each interface.  Each interface
has its MAC address in its tool-tip.</p>

<p>If you see multiple interfaces of the same type, and you aren't expecting
this, your hardware may have been incorrectly detected by Ad√©lie Linux.  You
