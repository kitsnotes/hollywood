<h2>Networking Setup</h2>

<p>This page allows you to configure your network or Internet connection.</p>

<h3>Which option should I choose?</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most home and small business users will choose Automatic.</strong>
This will configure your computer to connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi or an
Ethernet cable.  Your computer must be connected to a switch, router, or modem
that allows your computer to configure itself for access the Internet over a
standard called DHCP.  Almost all modems and routers support this standard.
For Wi-Fi connections, you will be able to specify your access point name
(SSID) and password, if necessary.<br></li>
<li>Some users will need to choose Manual.  You will need to choose Manual if
you use a proxy server, or if you have a static IP address issued by your
network administrator or ISP (uncommon).  System Installation will allow you to
specify the settings you require to connect to your network and/or the
Internet.<br></li>
<li>If you do not wish to connect to a network or the Internet, you may choose
Skip.  Note that you will only be able to choose Skip if you have the full
installation media for your platform, and some software collections may be
unavailable.</li>
</ul>
