<h2>Date and Time Settings</h2>

<p>This page allows you to configure your computer's date and time.  It also
allows you to configure your computer's time zone.</p>

<h3>How do I know which time zone to select?</h3>

<p>If you're installing Adélie Linux on a desktop, workstation, or laptop
computer, choose the time zone where you are located, or where you will use
the computer the most.  If you have another device with you that has Internet
access, you may find your local time zone by using the interactive map at
<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/">
https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/</a>.</p>

<p>If you're installing Adélie Linux on a server system, you should almost
always use UTC.  This ensures that Daylight Savings Time will not adversely
affect running services.</p>
