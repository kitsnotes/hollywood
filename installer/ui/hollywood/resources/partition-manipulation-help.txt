<h2>Select Partitioning Type</h2>

<p>This page allows you to select how you want to partition the disk you have
selected for installation.  Depending on the disk's current configuration, you
may have any of the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Erase and Use Whole Disk</strong>: This option will erase all data
currently on the disk, and then configure the entire disk to be used for Adélie
Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure any data on this disk has been backed up to other media
before selecting this option.</strong>  You will not be able to recover any
data from the disk after installation is completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Free Space</strong>: This option will install Adélie Linux in to
the free space present on the selected disk.  No existing data will be erased.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Exising Partition(s)</strong>: This option will allow you to
choose a partition already present on the selected disk for installation.  You
may select to erase the partition, or install to a partition that is already
formatted.</p>
<p>Note: If an existing Linux or Unix system is already present on the selected
partition, it may be damaged.  Always ensure that you select a partition that
can be used exclusively by Adélie Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual</strong>: This option will open a partition editor for you to
manipulate partitions in whatever way you wish.  After you are finished in the
partition editor, you will be able to select the mount points of the partitions.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
