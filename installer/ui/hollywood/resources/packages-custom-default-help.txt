<h2>Software Choices</h2>

<p>This page allows you to select the software you wish to use in certain
roles on your system.  The defaults used by standard installations of Adelie
Linux are always on the left side.</p>

<p>Most users do not need to change these options.</p>


<hr>


<h3>Shell to use for /bin/sh</h3>

<p>This section allows you to choose which shell will be used for shell scripts
that use <code>/bin/sh</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dash</strong>: The lightweight Dash shell is an Almquist-style
shell.  This is the default shell used by Adelie for /bin/sh, and is used for
/bin/sh on Debian-derived distributions.  This option provides faster boot
times and full POSIX compatibility.</li>
<li>Bash: This shell is popular on GNU systems.  This option provides
compatibility with non-portable scripts.  <em>Note that by choosing this
option, your system will no longer be able to conform to the POSIX standard.
</li>
</ul>


<hr>


<h3>Init system (/sbin/init)</h3>

<p>This section allows you to choose which init system will be used to start up
your computer.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>s6-linux-init</strong>: The lightweight, customisable s6-linux-init
init system has been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and
efficient.  Using this system provides full LSB compatibility with init control
and shutdown commands.</li>
<li>SysV Init: The traditional Linux init system was at one time widely
deployed, but has fallen out of favour recently due to issues with supervision
and power usage.</li>
</ul>


<hr>


<h3>uevent management daemon</h3>

<p>This section allows you to choose which daemon will be used to manage kernel
uevents.  <strong>Modifying this option may cause improper system operation or
failure to boot.  Only modify this option if you know what you are doing.
</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>eudev</strong>: The traditional eudev system provides a standard
UDev-compatible interface.  It is highly recommended that you use eudev unless
you know it is inappropriate for your use case.</li>
<li>mdevd: The minimalist, lightweight mdevd system is the skarnet fork of
the mdev system from BusyBox.  Choosing this option on a desktop system will
require manual intervention.</li>
</ul>
