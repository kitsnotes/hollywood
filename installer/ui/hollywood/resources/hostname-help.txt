<h2>Computer Name</h2>

<p>This page allows you to set the name of your computer.  The name of your
computer will appear in various places, such as the system startup screen,
log files, and the Applications menu.</p>

<p>For home users, it's best to provide a descriptive name of the location
and/or owner of the computer.  For example, <i>Living-Room-PC</i> or
<i>Annas-PC</i>.  Note that if you have a home network, you will need to
make sure that each computer has a different name.  Otherwise, some
applications may not function correctly.</p>
