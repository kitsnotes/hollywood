<h2>Software Selection</h2>

<p>This page allows you to choose the software you want to install on this
computer.  You will have the option to add and remove software using the
Package Manager once Adélie Linux is installed, so you can change your mind
at any time.</p>

<h3>Which option should I choose?</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most users should choose Standard.</strong>  This option will
install software for everday computing: a Web browser, an email client, a
media player, a word processor, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> installs the same software as Standard, with
additional tools and utilities that are useful for laptop and tablet
computers.  This includes touchpad software, tablet control software, and
extra power management tools.</li>
<li><strong>Compact</strong> installs a desktop environment, LXQt, that
is more suitable for less powerful computers.  It also includes the light
Netsurf Web browser, and the Featherpad text editor.</li>
<li><strong>Text-Only</strong> installs only text-mode or command line
software.  You should select this option if you are installing Adélie
Linux on a server, or if you do not want to use a graphical user interface
on your computer.</li>
<li>If you want to have finer-grained selection on the software that will be
installed on your computer, choose <strong>Custom</strong>.  This option
will allow you to select software to install from a list.</li>
</ul>
