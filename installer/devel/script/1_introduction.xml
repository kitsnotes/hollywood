        <title>Intended Audience</title>
        <para>This document is intended to be used by developers and researchers, to implement Project Horizon 1.0 and study how Project Horizon accomplishes its goals of installing and configuring Adélie Linux.  This document may also be used by Administrators intended to hand-write their own HorizonScript, though this activity is only recommended for advanced users.  This document is additionally intended to be used by the wider Adélie Linux community to determine how Project Horizon is designed, its intended purposes, and for development of future releases of Project Horizon.</para>
