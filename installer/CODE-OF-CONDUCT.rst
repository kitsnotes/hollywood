 Code of Conduct for Project Horizon
=====================================



Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the Ad√©lie
Linux community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.  We
are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient**: Remember: you might not be communicating in
  someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not
  have your level of understanding.

* **Be welcoming**: Our community welcomes and supports people of all types
  and backgrounds.  This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
  ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
  economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
  and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and
  mental and physical ability.

* **Be respectful**: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we
  conduct ourselves professionally.  Disagreement is no excuse for poor
  behavior and poor manners.  Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior
  includes, but is not limited to:

  * Violent threats or language.

  * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.

  * Posting gratuitous, sexually explicit or violent material.

  * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").

  * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.

  * Behavior that could be perceived as unwanted sexual attention.

  * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

* **Understand disagreements**: Disagreements, both social and technical, are
  useful learning opportunities.  Seek to understand the other viewpoints and
  resolve differences constructively.

This code is not exhaustive or complete.  It serves to capture our common
understanding of a productive, collaborative environment.  We expect the code
to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.


Reporting Code of Conduct Issues
================================

We encourage our community to resolve issues on their own whenever possible.
This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier
interaction.  In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please
feel free to report your concerns by contacting the Community Arbitration
team.  Your report will be handled in accordance with our issue resolution
processes.

In your report please include:

* Your contact information.

* Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.  If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well.

* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
  If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a
  public chat log), please include a link or attachment.

* Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  Where
additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with
relevant expertise or experience.  The confidentiality of the person reporting
the incident will be kept at all times.  Involved parties are never part of
the review team.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any
action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.
