.Sh NAME
.Nm hscript-validate
.Nd ensure the validity of a HorizonScript
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hiknsv
.Ar INSTALLFILE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility validates a HorizonScript, ensuring that it is free from syntax
errors and that all required values are present and meet any requirements.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Displays a help message, and then exits.
.It Fl i
Set the Installation Environment flag.  This is VERY DANGEROUS, as it will
treat your host system as the target for purposes of validation.  Unless you
are very sure of what you are doing, do not use this flag!
.It Fl k
Keep going after parsing errors.  This allows you to see all errors at once,
instead of having each error be immediately fatal.
.It Fl n
Disables colour output and ANSI escape sequences in any log messages.  This
is the default when not running from a terminal.
.It Fl s
Enables Strict mode, which causes more potential issues to be errors instead
of warnings.
.It Fl v
Displays the version information for this utility, and then exits.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
