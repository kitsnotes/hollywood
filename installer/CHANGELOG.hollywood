The Horizon installer system has differences between
Ad√©lie Linux and Hollywood.  HorizonScripts should
NOT be shared between the two.

* Changed naming and visual UI
* Moved default script from /etc/horizon/installfile to /etc/hollywood.hs
* Removed all architecture support besides aarch64 and x86_64
* Added token 'kernel' for supplying linux (lts, mainline or none)
* Removed requirement of 'pkginstall' - hollywood base installed by default
* Removed netif/interface support for connman
* Added support for deploying refind bootloader
* Added vfat support to GRUB in ISO image builder (for rufus/etc USB support)
* Added support for using btrfs as volume file system.
* Removal of jfs/xfs support (only vfat, btrfs, ext4 supported)
* /etc/fstab and boot loader configuration uses UUID instead of /dev/sdaX names
