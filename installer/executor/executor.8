.Dt HSCRIPT-EXECUTOR 8
.Os "Ad√©lie Linux"
.Sh NAME
.Nm hscript-executor
.Nd install a Linux system based on a HorizonScript
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs a Linux system to /target on the current system, configured
as described in a given HorizonScript.
.Pp
It is assumed that
.Xr hscript-fetch 8
has been run before
.Nm ,
as this utility places the desired HorizonScript in the location where
.Nm
expects it to be.
.Ss Steps
Horizon divides an installation into
.Qq steps ,
which are a grouping of related installation processes.  The steps defined
in this version of Horizon are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It validate
The
.Cm validate
step performs validation of the HorizonScript, ensuring that it can be
executed on the current system.
.It disk
The
.Cm disk
step performs disk initialisation and preparation, including any labeling,
partitioning, file system creation, and mounting.
.It pre-metadata
The
.Cm pre-metadata
step performs configuration of early system metadata that must be complete
before networking is set up.  This includes setting the hostname, setting up
APK repositories, and (in some cases) setting up initial firmware loads.
.It net
The
.Cm net
step performs all networking configuration.  This includes setting up the
network in the target system, and (if the
.Cm network
key in the HorizonScript is set to true) configuring the network on the
current host.
.It pkgdb
The
.Cm pkgdb
step performs initial APK configuration and then installs the desired packages
to the target environment.
.It post-metadata
The
.Cm post-metadata
step performs configuration of system metadata.  This includes setting the root
passphrase, the keymap, any user accounts requested, and the system timezone.
