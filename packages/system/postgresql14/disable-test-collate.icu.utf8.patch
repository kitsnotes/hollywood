Regression test collate.icu.utf8 fails with the following error:

    ERROR:  collations with different collate and ctype values are not supported by ICU
    CONTEXT:  SQL statement "CREATE COLLATION test1 (provider = icu, lc_collate = 'C', lc_ctype = 'C.UTF-8');"
    PL/pgSQL function inline_code_block line 3 at EXECUTE

I don't know how to fix nor what's the cause. Unsetting LC_COLLATE (it's set
to `C` by /etc/profile.d/locale.sh) or setting it to `C.UTF-8` didn't help.
