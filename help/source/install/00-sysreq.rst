System requirements
==========================================

CPU
--------
Hollywood requires a system with a 64-bit AMD/Intel Processor, or a compatible 64-bit ARM processor. The following
processors are fully supported by Hollywood:

* AMD Ryzen processors.
* AMD Athlon 64 processors released after 2012.
* Intel i3/i5/i7/i9 processors.
* Intel Celeron/Pentium processors released after 2012.
* Ampere Altra processors.
* Apple Silicon processors.

Hollywood may run on additional 64-bit processors not listed above, however, their use will result in an unsupported configuration.

Memory 
-------
All Hollywood systems should have 4GiB of system (DDR) memory or higher. Hollywood may run on lower amounts of system RAM,
using amounts lower than 4GiB however, their use will result in an unsupported configuration.

Firmware
---------
Hollywood systems require a 64-bit Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware. On Apple Silicon systems
this support is provided by the Hollywood operating system.

64-bit PC systems that do not contain a compatible UEFI firmware, but instead contain a legacy BIOS are unable
to run the Hollywood operating system.

Unsupported configuration
--------------
When your specifications do not match the minimum requirements (except the system firmware), the Hollywood
installer will advise you however you will not be prevented from completing the installation.  Please be advised that the
performance of Hollywood will not be optimal on an unsupported configuration.
